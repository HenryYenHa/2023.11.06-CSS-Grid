      <h2>Dartboard</h2>
      <p>
        According to the <em>Darts Regulation Authority</em>, a
        <strong>regulation board</strong> is 451 mm (17.8 in) in diameter and is
        divided into 20 radial sections. Each section is separated with metal
        wire or a thin band of sheet metal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quality dartboards are still made of sisal fibres from Eastern Africa,
        Brazil, and China; less expensive boards are sometimes made of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(material)">cork</a> or
        coiled paper.
      </p>

      <h2>Darts</h2>

      <p>
        Modern darts are made up of four components: the points, the barrels,
        the shafts and the flights.
      </p>

      <p>
        The points come in two common lengths, 32 and 41 mm (1.3 and 1.6 in) and
        are sometimes knurled or coated to improve players' grip. Others are
        designed to retract slightly on impact to lessen the chance of the dart
        bouncing out.
      </p>

      <p>
        The barrels come in a variety of weights and are usually constructed
        from brass, silver-nickel, or a tungsten alloy. Brass is cheap but light
        and therefore brass barrels tend to be very bulky. Tungsten, on the
        other hand, is twice as dense as brass; thus a tungsten barrel of
        equivalent weight could be thirty percent smaller in diameter than a
        brass one. Pure tungsten is very brittle, however, so an alloy is
        commonly used, with between 80 and 95 percent tungsten and the remainder
        usually nickel, iron, or copper. Silver-nickel darts offer a compromise
        between density and cost. Barrels come in three basic shapes:
        cylindrical, ton, or torpedo.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Cylindrical barrels are the same diameter along their entire length
          and so tend to be long and thin. Their slenderness makes them better
          for grouping, but because they are long, the centre of gravity is
          further back.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ton-shaped barrels are thin at either end and bulge in the middle.
          This makes them fatter than a cylindrical barrel of equivalent weight
          but the centre of gravity is further forward and so theoretically
          easier to throw.
        </li>
        <li>
          Torpedo-shaped barrels are widest at the pointed end and taper towards
          the rear. This shape keeps the bulk of the weight as far forward as
          possible but, like the ton, gives it a larger diameter than the
          cylinder.
        </li>
      </ul>

          According to international regulation, the dartboard center should be
          placed 1.73 m (5 ft 8 in) from the floor, with a horizontal distance
          of 2.37 m (7 ft 9 in) from the back of the 61 cm (24 in) throwing line
          (Oche) to the face of the dartboard.
